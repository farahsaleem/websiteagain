Something that I was looking forward to when taking SDS 348 was learning how to use python. Python is a programming language that can be used for websites, web applications and common programming tasks.  
The best thing about Python is that it can be used on various platforms, one of them being R studio. This can be done by using the package "reticulate" on R as demonstrated below. 

```{R}
library(reticulate)
```
Now that reticulate is installed, we can use python on R studio! Python has basic built in functions such as creating lists, the function below shows the length of the list created, which is 3. 
```{python}
x=range(2,8,2)
x=list(x)
len(x)
```

The function below is the insert function, used to insert an element at any location in a list, here the number 5 is inserted at the 4th position, R positions start from 0.
```{python}
list1=[1,2,3,4]
list1.insert(4,5)
list1[4]
list1
```
R also has other functions, which are very simple to use such as append: which adds a number to the list, reverse which sorts the list in opposite order. Both of these functions are demonstrated below!
```{python}
list1.append(6)
list1
list1.reverse()
list1
```
```
