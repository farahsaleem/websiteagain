<p>Something that I was looking forward to when taking SDS 348 was learning how to use python. Python is a programming language that can be used for websites, web applications and common programming tasks.<br />
The best thing about Python is that it can be used on various platforms, one of them being R studio. This can be done by using the package “reticulate” on R as demonstrated below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)</code></pre>
<p>Now that reticulate is installed, we can use python on R studio! Python has basic built in functions such as creating lists, the function below shows the length of the list created, which is 3.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x=range(2,8,2)
x=list(x)
len(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 3</code></pre>
<p>The function below is the insert function, used to insert an element at any location in a list, here the number 5 is inserted at the 4th position, R positions start from 0.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list1=[1,2,3,4]
list1.insert(4,5)
list1[4]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 5</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>list1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code></pre>
<p>R also has other functions, which are very simple to use such as append: which adds a number to the list, reverse which sorts the list in opposite order. Both of these functions are demonstrated below!</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list1.append(6)
list1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>list1.reverse()
list1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</code></pre>
<p>```</p>
